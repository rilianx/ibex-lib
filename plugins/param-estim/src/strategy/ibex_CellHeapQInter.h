	 * \brief Build a cell heap for optimization.
	 *
	 * Build a cell heap that stores (n+1)-dimensional boxes of the following form: <br>
	 * ([x]_1,...[x]_n,[y]) <br>
	 * where "y" is a specific variable that is assumed to be the criterion to be minimized.
	 * Typically, [y] is the image of a function f calculated on the box [x]=([x]_1,...[x]_n). <br>
	 *
	 * The heap is built so that:
	 *  <ul>
	 *  <li> #pop() returns in logarithmic time
	 *    the box ([x],[y]) with the minimal lower bound for [y].
	 *    among all the boxes in the list</li>
	 *  <li> #push() is also in logarithmic time.</li>
	 *  </ul>
	 *
	 * \param y - the index of the variable "y" that contains the criterion (typically, f(x)) in each cell's box.
